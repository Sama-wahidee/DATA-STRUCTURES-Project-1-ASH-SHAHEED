# 🌟 ASH-SHAHEED 🌟

**ASH-SHAHEED** is a comprehensive tool designed to manage and display martyr data efficiently. 

## 🔧 Data Structures

The ASH-SHAHEED system uses an efficient linked list architecture:

- **Doubly Linked List:** Manages different locations. Each node represents a location and contains a Singly Linked List.
- **Singly Linked List:** Holds martyr data specific to each location. This approach allows for efficient traversal and management of both locations and martyr records.
